# Dynamic Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

This project creates a web application that enables dynamic image generation using the Stable Diffusion model, paired with a Gradio interface. Users can enter textual prompts and adjust optional parameters to produce customized images, making it suitable for creators and developers. The application simplifies interactions with an API to receive images in base64 format and convert them to display-ready formats. It features a user-friendly Gradio interface that includes a main input for prompts, advanced customizable options, and a submit button to generate and display images based on user inputs.
