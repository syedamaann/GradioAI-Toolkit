# Automated Image Captioning with BLIP

This project develops a Python-based web application for automated image captioning using the BLIP model, integrated with a Gradio interface to facilitate user-friendly interactions. Users can upload images and receive concise captions that describe the image content, suitable for both technical and non-technical users needing quick captioning services. The implementation involves a function `get_completion` for communicating with the BLIP API, and `image_to_base64_str` for converting images to base64 strings for API submission. The Gradio-based interface includes an image upload field, a textbox for captions, and sample images, all configured to run on a designated server port with privacy-conscious settings.
