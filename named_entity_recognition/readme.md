# Named Entity Recognition with dslim/bert-base-NER

This project develops a web application for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the `dslim/bert-base-NER` model and a Gradio interface. It allows users to input text and automatically identifies entities such as names, locations, and organizations, making it valuable for developers, data scientists, and linguists. The application processes text through an API to detect entities, merges related tokens for clearer output, and displays results in a Gradio interface where recognized entities are visually highlighted. The setup is designed to handle user inputs dynamically, updating the display with processed entity data effectively.
