# Text Summarization with distilbart-cnn

This project develops a web application for text summarization using the `shleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model through a Gradio interface. Designed for students, researchers, journalists, and professionals, it allows users to input extensive texts and quickly obtain concise summaries. The application uses a function to interact with the summarization API, sending texts and processing responses into summarized outputs. It features a Gradio interface with input and output text boxes for easy submission and review of summaries, and updates dynamically to display results immediately, enhancing user experience and efficiency.
