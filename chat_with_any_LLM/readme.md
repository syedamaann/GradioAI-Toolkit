# Conversational AI with FalconLM-instruct

### Introduction
This project implements a conversational AI web application using the `FalconLM-instruct` model hosted on a language model platform. It utilizes a Gradio interface to provide a responsive chatbot that users can interact with, simulating a real-time conversation with an AI. The application is designed for users who require interactive dialogue capabilities, ranging from customer service scenarios to educational tools and entertainment applications.

### Implementation Details
The implementation details of this project include:
1. **Environment and API Key Management**: Uses the `dotenv` library to securely manage environment variables, including loading an API key necessary for interacting with the language model API.
2. **Chat Functionality**:
   - **Format Chat Prompt**: Formats the chat history and current user message into a structured prompt for the model.
   - **Respond Function**: Handles sending the formatted prompt to the `FalconLM-instruct` model, receives the model's response, updates the chat history, and returns the updated chat to the user.
3. **Streaming Responses**: Uses a streaming API to handle long-running conversations where the response is built incrementally, ensuring fluid and natural dialogue.
4. **Gradio Interface Configuration**:
   - The interface includes a main chat window and a text input box for user messages.
   - Advanced options are available under an accordion for setting system parameters like response temperature to adjust the conversational style of the AI.
   - Interaction handling is designed to accept both button clicks and enter key submissions for message sending, enhancing user accessibility.
5. **Session Management**: Implements functions to manage the conversation history, ensuring continuity throughout the session and providing a coherent conversation flow.
