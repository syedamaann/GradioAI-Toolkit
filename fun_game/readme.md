# Interactive Image Captioning and Generation Game

This project creates an interactive game that allows users to upload images and engage with AI to generate and transform captions into new images, utilizing Hugging Face's machine learning models for seamless text-to-image and image-to-text conversions. Developed in Python with libraries like `requests` for API interactions, `PIL` for image processing, and `gradio` for the web interface, the application features a user-friendly setup for uploading and viewing images, managing API keys, and converting images for API use. The server-hosted game is accessible online, offering real-time, interactive AI experiences.
